#A Famous/Angular Seed

Based on: [Famo.us](https://famo.us/integrations/angular/#/intro)

##Dependencies
It is actually quite simple really

First make sure you have node.js installed... without that nothing works!  You can either install it with your favorite package manager or with [the installer](http://nodejs.org/download) found on [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

This project relies on grunt-cli, and bower to do all the heavy lifting for you

```
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

##Getting Started

```
npm install && bower install
```

That's it!!!

##Running the Development Server

Simply run ```grunt serve``` and you will start a local development server and open Chrome.  Watch tasks will be running, and your browser will be automatically refreshed whenever a file in the repo changes.
